Build a Telegram-based cloud storage service similar to Google Drive, where users can upload and download files via a centralized Telegram channel (owned by the app). All Telegram interactions should be handled using TDLib, while firebase is used for storing metadata and managing user authentication.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js
Backend: NestJS
Database & Auth: firebase (Auth, Meta data storage)
Telegram Integration: TDLib (Telegram Database Library)
System Features:
Authentication:
Users log in via firebase Auth
Upon login, a secure API token is issued for authenticated access
File Upload Flow:
User selects file in React.js frontend
File is sent to the NestJS backend
Backend uses TDLib to send the file to a single private Telegram channel
After successful upload(Sending to private telegram channel), metadata is stored in firebase, including:
file_name, file_type, file_size, file_link
uploader_id, upload_timestamp
telegram_message_id, channel_id
File Download Flow:
Users can view their files via a React-based dashboard
When downloading, the system retrieves the file from Telegram using the message ID or file link via TDLib
Access is secured and authorized based on user session
Frontend (React.js):
OAuth login (using firebase)
Upload interface (progress + file validations)
File list (name, size, date) with download buttons
Error/success notifications
Backend (NestJS):
Exposes authenticated REST APIs for:
Uploading files
Listing files (filtered by user)
Downloading files
Integrates with TDLib for file upload/download
Uses firebase SDK to read/write metadata
Key Constraints:
All files are stored in one Telegram channel I own and control
TDLib must run as a Telegram client session linked to your app
firebase handles authentication, authorization, and all metadata storage
Must support Telegram's file size limits (~2GB) for more than 2GB separate them and send them.
Bonus Features (Optional):
File previews (images, PDFs)
Quota enforcement per user (e.g., max 5GB/user)
File expiration policy
Admin panel for managing files and users
Shared file links with limited-time access
